## Introduction

Over the course of playing around with setting up archlinux I have come to come up with some preferences in my setup, the idea behind this repo was to create a way of backing up the hardwork going into ricing my linux, or for hydrating my
enviroment when setting up a new device

## How this Repo works

### Wallpapers
When using this repo I would advise starting by using the existing wallpapers folder as your directory for your wallpapers app. In my case I used a combination of waypaper with swww. From there use the waypaper scripts found in the scripts folder and put them in the corresponding folders (I am currently forgetting what folders they go in so I will update this part again with the correct path)

### Waybar

Next copy the files within the waybar folder, cp -r waybar /etc/xdg/ 
**Note: Unless you setup your rofi power menu before hand this will not work properly**
